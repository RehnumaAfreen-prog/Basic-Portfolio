    <h3>The Studio Glibli Movie series</h3>
    <p>This is my favourite amine series. I love the beautiful stories and animations.

      and has produced twenty-two feature-length films.

    <h3>Harry potter series</h3>
    <p>Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. 
      The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, 
      all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns Harry's conflict 
      with Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, 
      overthrow the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic, 
      and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical people).</p>
    <h3>The Quiet Place</h3>
    <p>In a devastated Earth overrun by invincible predators of a possible extraterrestrial origin, 
      the Abbotts are struggling to survive in the desolate urban jungle of New York City: a death 
      trap defined by a new era of utter silence. Indeed, as noise attracts this new type of invader, 
      even the slightest of sounds can be deadly. However, even though it's already been twelve months 
      since the powerful monsters' first sightings, the resilient Abbott family still stands strong. 
      In this muted dystopia, learning the rules of survival is crucial. And now, more than ever, 
      the Abbotts must not make a sound.</p>
